Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a communication technology that uses radio frequency waves to identify and track objects or living things through special tags.RFID is a wireless communication method that utilizes electromagnetic and electrostatic coupling within the radio frequency spectrum to establish communication between a reader and a tag.Nowadays, the conventional method used by most universities for taking attendance, which involves calling out names or signing on paper, is highly time-consuming and inefficient. However, by leveraging RFID technology to uniquely identify each person through RFID tags, the attendance recording process can be significantly accelerated and streamlined compared to the conventional method.
